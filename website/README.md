Building and running the UI
To build and run the website you need to install docker and then simply run `./dev-site.sh`.
This will download a docker image with jekyll, pygments and all the dependencies needed to build the website.
It will run it in watch mode, meaning that you can do live changes to the website and see the result at `localhost:4040`.
